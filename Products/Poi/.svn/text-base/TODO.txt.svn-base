Poi TODO
========

Items marked with ** are show-stoppers for next release 

Within [brackets] is the person who came up with this todo and the
date that the item was added to this list.

Fixes:
------

Bugs/Known issues:

    o _renameAfterCreation() counter is not thread safe

Security issues:

    o Add max-size validator on uploaded attachments?

User interface:

    o Issues-by-tag UI on tracker front page needs more thinking
        - Need a quick and easy way to find issues by tag
        - Need a quick and easy way to add tags to issues
    
    o Consider threaded responses (maybe not by default)

    o Enable quoting other responses/issue text in responses
        - May be able to plug into Ploneboard?
        
    o Would be nice to link to releases when in PSC view

    o No way to specify sort order in issue search form, and no sensible
        way of sorting by severity

    o Want to have sortable tables, but they look funny without nosort if
        the title makes a row two lines long or more

General:

    o Move completely from i18n to locales?  Not sure if this is
        needed/useful.  [maurits]

    o Move to blob storage for the attachment in PoiIssue and in the
        new style responses.  [maurits]
